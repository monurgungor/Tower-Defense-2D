This is my first case interview project. Everything was done in 1 week. So that I had to shortcut some features and I am aware it caused complicated code. 

I think not using object pooling for projectiles was a big mistake for this project.

The game has 3 levels now. Implementing an auto level designer would be great and it would've provide a better game feel.

Despite all that, it was an educative experience that i enjoyed.

I am planning to update the game in the future to see how much progress I made since making this game. Also I want to test out how could it be if the time wasn't limited.
